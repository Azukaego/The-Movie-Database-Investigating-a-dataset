## by (Azukaego Uzoagozie Umeononigwe)


## Introduction of the Dataset
The Movie Database (TMDB) which is a collection of 10,000 movies of different genres collected over a period of fifty years. The database give details about the gnere of the movie, the amount expended and corresponding revenue, the release date and year as well as the title. Other information provided are the popularity, directors, cast, homepage, amongst other relevenat information.
The goal is to analyse the data set to find out the distribution of the movies by release year as well as characteristics of movies with high revenue.
The dataset was analysed, wrangled and cleaned to ensure there were no missing data before carrying out exploratory data analysis


## Summary of Finding
There is a direct correlation between the budget and revenue generated as both are skewed to the right
Also, the popularity chart shares similar trend with the budget and revenue chart which suggests a relationship
A signifant amount of the movies had their runtime between 0 and 200
clear relationship between budget and revenue with the revenue increasing as budget was increased.


## Key Insight
Revenue is dependent on the budget expended in producing the movie
Movies with high revenue have high budget and high vote_count


## Limitations
More information on the geographical location will help know what could have caused the variation in the number of movies released
The data did not give information on the currency of the revenue and budget. A variation in the currency can affect our analysis significantly
A breakdown of the revenue source was not indicated which could really help in segmenting the impact of vote_count and budget on revenue
